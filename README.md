# Algorithm-Snippets

Free of adding the algorithm templates for codeforces, atcoder, oi/icpc etc.

## Install

### Vim

You can easily add this plugin within your chosen plugin manager.

I take vim-plug for example:

```vimscript
Plug 'SirVer/ultisnips'                " Required
  let g:UltiSnipsExpandTrigger="<tab>" " Use TAB to implement

Plug 'TRSWNCA/Algorithm-Snippets'      " Plugin here
```

Just after the plugin installed, you are allowed to use those snippets!

## Contribution

This repo will add the basic snippets (maybe less than 40 lines each), and some useful template (like adding the handle and date).

So if you want to expand the feature of this plugin, you can **fork** to your repo and **pull request**.

Anyway, I **STRONGLY** encourage you to fork and customize it.
